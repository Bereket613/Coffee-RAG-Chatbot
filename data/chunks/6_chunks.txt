INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND   
Unlike  coffee producing countries in Latin America and Asia, the coffee sector is constrained by the 
prevailing ineffective and inefficient policy frameworks in promoting coffee production, processing 
and marketing systems in several African coutries (ICO, 2015).

==== CHUNK ====

Ethiopia has not fully exploited its 
vast natural endowment of genetic and unique natural coffee environments due to several factors, 
including insufficient access to finance and poor input distribution mechanisms for small-scale coffee 
farmers, predominant use of local landrace coffee types, traditional management, harvesting and post-
processing practices as well as lack of quality differentiated marketing system.

==== CHUNK ====

The current climate 
Abstract: Ethiopia has unable to fully exploit from the unique natural and socio-cultural coffee 
opportunities, largely due to challenges related to coffee germplasm conservation, coffee research and 
extension services, coffee quality and marketing as well as linkages among the stakeholders. These 
constraints coupled with anthropological activities and climate changes are threatening arabica coffee 
genetic diversity and environmental sustainability. The national average coffee productivity remains too low 
and the quality standards are below expectations.

==== CHUNK ====

This primarily stems from the predominantly coffee grown 
by small-scale farmers, most of whom are resource poor and depend on traditional practices. The Jimma 
Research Center (JRC) had made concerted works in collecting and preserving arabica coffee germplasm 
accessions (a total of 6923 original collections) at research field gene banks. The national coffee research 
has contributed in safeguarding the coffee sector from the possible irreversible losses due to the severe 
outbreak of coffee berry disease in the country. Coffee research has also played crucial contributions for 
increasing coffee productivity and production and export earnings.

==== CHUNK ====

So far, 42  arabica coffee varieties (35 
pure-lines and 7 hybrids) along with improved pre-and post-harvest handling practices have been generated 
for specific agro-ecologies of the country. The national coffee research projects were also designed for 
generation and promotion of improved technologies, information and knowledge at each agro-ecological 
zone. Nonetheless, the recommended and proven practices were less diffused due to several reasons including 
the weak linkages among stakeholders, low price share to growers, limited capacity building, shortage of 
credit access, shortage of tools and inputs and high costs, among others.

==== CHUNK ====

Above all, there is an acute shortage 
of suitable varieties due to the absence formal coffee seed enterprises, except the JRC that supplies limited 
quantity of improved coffee seeds and seedlings. There should also be vibrant collaborations between coffee 
value-chain actors for encouraging sustainable production and price incentive mechanisms for the high 
quality coffee varieties and natural forest coffee landscapes, while promoting the green economy development 
strategy. In general, capacitated national coffee research is crucial for transforming the Ethiopian coffee 
industry.

==== CHUNK ====

This would promote, inter alias, commercial-oriented coffee production and marketing for ensuring 
competitiveness of the value-chain actors and become center of excellence for research and training on 
arabica coffee.

To modernize  research programs, generate technologies, and adequately provide important 
services to actors along the value chain coffee Research strategy published in 2017,  moreover on improving 
the entire value chain, highlighting strategic issues and recommendations across four pillars: 1) Research, 2) 
Extension and Production, 3) Value-addition and Marketing, and 4) Cross-Cutting and Sustainability 
(environmental and social) Comprehensive Ethiopian Coffee Strategy was developed in 2018,  by Ethiopian 
coffee and Tea Authority in collaboration with EIAR and Technoserve. This paper highlights the status of 
major achievements and future prospects of coffee research in Ethiopia.

change and variability has also noted to hamper the overall national coffee production and 
productivity.

==== CHUNK ====

Coffee plays a very important role in the national economy as a total of 5.3 million small-holders 
directly involved in producing coffee about 30 million people directly or indirectly depends in post-
harvesting activities. Ethiopia is a leading arabica coffee producer in Africa and ranks as the fifth 
producer and tenth coffee exporter in the world. Ethiopia needs to increase production and export 
volumes and optimize export prices. While Brazil exported 33 million bags in 2017, Ethiopia 
exported around 10% of that - just 3 million bags, behind Peru, Uganda, and India.

==== CHUNK ====

Coffee is still a leading export commodity and source of foreign exchange, though the shares of coffee 
export for the same period from agricultural commodities and total export revealed declining patterns, 
due to fluctuating world coffee prices and trade diversifications (agricultural, industrial and mining 
products). About half of the total volume of coffee produced is exported, while 40-45 percent is 
estimated to be consumed locally with per capita consumption of 1.33 kg.

==== CHUNK ====

The coffee ceremony 
occurs daily and thus plays a vital role in the cultural, spiritual and socio-economic life; particularly 
the current booming outdoor cultural coffee ceremony services can provide job opportunity to million 
people in the country, 
The country has a diverse ecology and production system for growing coffee in all regional states 
with varying ranges of suitability and area coverage. Nevertheless, the major coffee growing areas are 
concentrated in the southwestern, southern, western, eastern and southeastern parts of the country. Limmu, Gimbi, Yirgacheffe and Harar are the most recognized brands that fetch premium prices in 
the international market (Figure 1).

==== CHUNK ====

(Coffee is produced under different production systems, including 
forest (8-10%), semi-forest (30-35%), cottage or home garden (50-55%), large-scale plantation (7-
8%) and semi-plantations. Accordingly, more than 90% of the total volume of coffee production 
comes from smallholders, whose average holding size is less than one hectare with low average 
productivity ranging from 200-250 kg /ha (Workafes and Kassu 2000). Thus, Ethiopian coffee can be 
considered de facto organic and demanded for its finest cup flavor, thought small-scale coffee growers 
have not fairly benefited and remain vulnerable (Taye and Tesfaye 2002).

==== CHUNK ====

It is still predominantly 
produced by small-scale farmers, many of whom are resource poor and do not use improved 
technologies and inputs, including agrochemicals. To ensure sustainability of coffee forest ecosystems 
and food security, it is critical to take urgent actions for mainstreaming shade-grown coffee 
landscapes through implementing sound quality accreditation and certification schemes. The use of 
geographical indicators and empowering small-scale farmers should get attentions for ensuring high 
quality traceability and consistency.

==== CHUNK ====

Likewise, developing new branding and promoting quality forest 
products and services are very important for sustainable management and conservation of forest 
ecosystems. In this regard, the important role of research-extension-marketing linkage in enhancing and 
productivity and quality cannot be overemphasized. To this end, Negusie et al. (2008) have indicated 
the attempts made by the JRC to foster links with coffee stakeholders to facilitate dissemination of 
improved coffee varieties, pre and post harvesting husbandry practices. Admassu et al.

==== CHUNK ====

(2008) have 
also listed the major reinforcing factors with regard to adoption of coffee berry disease (CBD) 
resistant selections in the country. Achieving the GTP targets in the coffee sector requires, inter alia, massive diffusion of improved and 
best technology options in small-scale coffee farming and private-public sectors. This may effected by 
supporting farmers’ organizations, cooperatives, and unions to sustain their innovative power in 
coffee production and marketing  through promoting information management and capacity 
development along the coffee value chains.

==== CHUNK ====

Coffee research should focus in generation and pre-
scaling-up of coffee technologies, including supply of reliable and high quality coffee seeds and 
seedlings for each area. The research-extension linkages should be considerably strengthened for 
establishment of multi-location demonstration sites preferably at farmers’ training centers and 
speeding-up of the recommended coffee technologies (Girma et al. 2008) and best practices at the 
major and new potential coffee growth corridors of the country.

In Ethiopia, four national coffee conferences had been conducted, including the first coffee 
symposium in 1986, the second workshop on coffee and associated crops in 1995, the third on control 
of coffee berry disease in Ethiopia in 1999 and the fourth on four-decades of coffee reesearch and

with their comprehensive information sources on Ethiopian coffee industry.

The major achievements, 
constraints and challenges in the areas of coffee genetic resources, coffee research, coffee 
development, coffee quality, as well as marketing and policy-issues and linkages among stakeholders 
have been synthesized and documented in a Coffee Diversity & Knowledge (Girma et al. 2008). It has 
underlined the need to develop and implement legal policy-frameworks on the utilization and 
protection of coffee genetic resources in Ethiopia, its birthplace.

2. HISTORY OF COFFEE RESEARCH IN ETHIOPIA 
2.1. Establishment  
Coffee research in Ethiopia has been started before the establishment of the Melko-Jimma Research 
Center in 1966.

==== CHUNK ====

In those early years, efforts were made to introduce coffee varieties from other 
countries, and these were tested for their adaptation at the Jimma Agricultural and Mechanical Arts 
School and later at the Jimma National Coffee Research Center. Coffee accessions were collected 
from India, Latin America, Africa, etc., and introduced to Ethiopia for their different characteristics. However, they performed poorly compared to the local collections. Very few had some good traits 
and most have failed to perform under different Ethiopian coffee agro-ecology. The establishment and development of coffee research in Ethiopia has been reviewed by Paulos 
(2008).

==== CHUNK ====

He pointed out that much more attention and strong support should be given to coffee research 
and that it should be made demand-driven and market-oriented. The systematic location of each of the 
established coffee research centers, sub-centers and testing sites was mainly targeted to represent the 
major coffee growing areas (Table 1). These were also augmented by various on-farm coffee adaptive 
research and demonstration sites stablished around each coffee research center in the country.

Establishment of coffee technology training centers like Gomma-II is a good strategy to enable rapid

The Jimma national coffee research coordinating center has a vision to be a leading center of 
excellence for arabica coffee research and training in the world.

==== CHUNK ====

Several research activities have been 
carried out at the Jimma Research Center (JRC) and other trial sites to generate and promote 
improved coffee technologies, information and knowledge in the country. The major research areas 
include coffee genetics and breeding, coffee agronomy and physiology, control of diseases, weeds and 
insect pests, soils and water management, coffee quality and socio-economic. Accordingly, a good 
number of coffee resereach recommendations, including  high yielding, disease resistant and top 
quality coffee varieties, improved management and post-harvesting technologies have been generated 
and transfered to various end-users and beneficiaries in the country.

==== CHUNK ====

However, the impact for 
increasing coffee productivity and enhancing qualiy standards remain low due to various reasons. Among others, limited research capacity, lack of  efficient technology transfer system and weak 
linkages among stakeholders along coffee value-chain actors were and still cited as bottleneck gaps 
that need due attentions (Girma et al. 2008). In addition to its major contributions to safeguard the country’s coffee genetic resources from loss due 
to CBD in 1971, the coffee research program had significant roles to the increased total coffee 
production, productivity and quality standards.

==== CHUNK ====

This has played remarkable role for increased volume 
of export coffees and thus maximum foreign earning benefits. In general, the present development of 
the national coffee industry and its improved contributions would have been impossible without the 
commitments of coffee researchers and their outstanding achievements. As a result, Dr.

Mesfin 
Ameha, senior coffee breeder, had the first the International Gold Mercury and national awards in 
1986 for his finding on hybrid vigor in arabica coffee and the national coffee team had won the 
second rank and award of the Federal Science and Technology for the year 2012 from the research 
and innovation group for their outstanding achievements on Ethiopian coffee varieties of specialty 
areas. Besides, the JRC has received several recognitions and appreciations almost on all the coffee 
events at regional and federal levels in the country. 2.2. Major Research Achievements

Coffee Genetic Resources  
Despite the constant threats to the Ethiopian coffee genetic resources, there are still different arabica 
coffee cultivars and local landraces possessing variations for improvements of yield and quality 
performances, disease resistance, drought tolerance, and other desirable agronomic traits. The local 
landrace coffee types are known by different vernacular names and growth characteristics at their 
geographical areas of origin in the country. According to Yacob et al. (1996), the Ethiopian coffee 
materials can be broadly categorized into three canopy natures, including open, intermediate and 
compact types.

They could also be of the bourbon or typica types, which are quite different in their 
shoot and root growth systems, as well as their characteristic adaptations to specific localities and/or 
respective response to the varied management inputs. The local coffee types vary in their frequency of 
occurrence along rainfall gradients and soil profile depths, indicating their long term adaptations to

In addition to the numerous farmers domesticated coffee types, according to 
the recent update, a total of 5853 are being conserved at different coffee research field gene banks 
(Table 2) for research purpose, though it requires high costs for establishment and long-term farm 
management operations. Table2.

According to the ISSR marker studies (Kassahu 2006), there was a clear differentiation among wild 
population in molecular characteristics whereby individuals collected from the same plot clustered 
together with strong group in undisturbed plots as compared with those from semi-disturbed ones.

==== CHUNK ====

This result was found to be very useful for fingerprinting the diverse coffee genetic resources in 
Ethiopia. Moreover, development of coffee trees under forest ecosystems is impaired due to several 
biotic and abiotic stresses, including diseases, insect pests, low sunlight interception and high 
humidity (Demelash T and Kifle B.2018). These problems are particularly witnessed in the forest, 
semi-forest and homestead and/or garden coffee systems, indicating the need for incentives like 
premium prices through sound certifications.

==== CHUNK ====

Arabica coffee germplasm accessions are seriously 
affected by different types of diseases, including coffee berry disease (CBD), coffee wilt disease 
(CWD) and coffee leaf rust. The spread of CWD is becoming a serious bottleneck threatening arabica 
coffee production and genetic diversity in the country. Hence, massive adoption of control practices, 
capacitating coffee research and development of disease resistance coffee varieties are among top 
priority areas. The regulations on coffee germplasm exchange and equitable benefit sharing and access and benefit 
sharing of coffee genetic resources and farmers’ indigenous knowledge need to be revised and 
approved by the Government.

==== CHUNK ====

There seems to be a reluctance and lack of concern from most public 
and private institutions in protecting and safeguarding Ethiopia's coffee genetic resources (Giram et 
al. 2008). Policy and regulations on farmers’ and researchers’ property rights should be urgently put 
in place and implemented. There is also a need to strengthen coordination among the stakeholders in 
the coffee sector and the public as a whole in awareness creation and shared vision regarding the 
serious consequences of informal and illegal transfer and use of arabica coffee genetic resources in 
jeopardizing the nation’s benefits from its unique natural coffee gene pools. 2.2.2.

Coffee Variety Development 
 Coffee Berry Disease Resistant Variety Development (1967-1981) 
The Jimma Research station commenced variety development activity in 1966/67. The first few years 
were the formative period, constructing offices, laboratories, greenhouses, and over all station 
development and infrastructure construction. During this period, some observation trials, more of 
agronomic, crop protection, processing studies, and adaptation trials were conducted. Basic research, 
which could be considered during the first phase, was started in 1968 and that continued until 1973. This was the period when the occurrence of coffee berry disease (CBD) was observed in Ethiopia.

==== CHUNK ====

The focus of the research at this time was based on variety improvement by collecting coffee seeds 
from different parts of the country and introducing back coffee lines that were collected from Ethiopia 
and being evaluated in many different parts of the world that are usually called French Mission 
Collection. At the same time agronomic practices such as forest coffee management, spacing trials, 
fertilizer management, stumping of old trees, and pruning were studied. The outbreak and spread of CBD took place during this period. It was also during this period that 
extension and research of coffee planned to work together and minimize the damage of CBD on the 
economy.

==== CHUNK ====

Hence, the CBD control program was drafted during this period and large number of CBD 
resistant selections and collections were made and evaluated. Since this was a period of crisis of the 
coffee industry. This was the period where all professionals, support staff and expatriates worked

together day and night. The work was supported by FAO and the EEC and the National Coffee Board 
was together with the research team.

==== CHUNK ====

It was during this period 18 CBD resistant selections were 
released and most of these are still under production, where three of them were withdrawn after few 
years of release.    Hybrid Variety Development  
 Since the beginning of hybrid variety development program with hybrid vigor study in 1978, a 
number of experiments on hybrid variety development were conducted. Consequently, the national 
coffee research program at the JRC has released seven  hybrids (Bayeta et al. 1998, Ayano A, K 
Nasiro, T Benti and N Meknnen, 2019). They are suitable to the low and mid altitude (1000-1750 
ma.s.l) in the southwestern coffee growing areas of the country.

==== CHUNK ====

The observed heterosis and hybrid 
vigor revealed in the relatively higher yield advantages of coffee hybrids over their pure-line parents 
(18-20%) had necessitated the research work to give peculiar emphasis to the development of more 
coffee hybrids (Behailu et al. 2008a). The coffee hybrids were found to be moderately resistant to 
CBD in contrast to the complete yield loss of local coffee types. Mean yield of the hybrids ranged from 24-26 q/ha on search station and about 13-20 q/ha in farmers 
field. The presence of high level of heterosis in crosses among elite indigenous coffee (Coffea arabica 
L.) cultivars was reported for the first time by an Ethiopian coffee scientist Mesfin Ameha.

==== CHUNK ====

The senior 
scientist acquire gold mercury medal for his outstanding achievement. The Ethiopian government also 
acknowledges the findings and offer award to the coffee scientist.  Local Landrace Development  
The conventional method of screening  contain several drawbacks: (1) difficulty to develop a number 
of varieties that adapt to all environments, (2) low preference of the released varieties by the local 
farmers when released to all areas, (3) adulteration of the typical quality of specific and known areas 
by introducing improved varieties originated in other areas.

==== CHUNK ====

Cognizant of the aforementioned 
drawbacks noted with the conventional approach and the environmental diversity of the major coffee 
growing areas, a new breeding strategy has been designed while preparing ten years development plan 
in 1991. This new selection and breeding strategy is known as ‘local landrace development program’. In this program, varieties are developed for each major agro-ecology or coffee growing area 
independently based on local landrace collections of the respective areas.

==== CHUNK ====

The basic assumptions are 
that (1) local landraces have better adaptation in their areas of origin than cultivars introduced from 
other geographical and ecological origins, (2) farmers show more preference for local cultivars than 
those improved varieties introduced from other areas, (3) it is possible to maintain the typical quality 
of each locality and (4) it is market oriented in a sense that consumers preference for a specific 
locality can be maintained and origin based diversity of pure line coffee varieties can be produced 
from pure line selection breeding program for the major coffee growing specialty areas as presented 
below.

==== CHUNK ====

Based on yield, disease resistance and quality, 11 selections were released in 2010 for Sidama, 
Yirgachefe , Wollega and Harrarghe coffee producing areas (MoARD, 2010). Figure2. Coffee varieties released from 1977-2018. Achievements and Prospects of Coffee Research in Ethiopia: A Review

2.2.3. Coffee Management  
Coffee growing agro-ecologies in Ethiopia reveal highly variable climates, soil types, and elevations 
ranging from 550-2,400 m.a.s.l. The ideal coffee soil is characterized by a brown red color of clay 
origin, having an average depth of one meter or more.

==== CHUNK ====

Well distributed rainfall with an annual average 
of 1400 mm or above, with aveage mimimum and maximum air temperatures of 10 and 240C, 
respectively is required for successful arabica coffee cultivation in Ethiopia (Paulos, 1994;  Bayeta et 
al. 1998). Coffee production and productivity can be improved by using improved agronomic and best 
management practices, such as adoption of best husbandry practices on old and new coffee 
plantations. Existing coffee stands suffer from poor returns, primarily due to old coffee trees, poor 
management and processing practices.

==== CHUNK ====

Both the coffee plants and its native shade trees are often found 
being old and irregularly spaced, suggesting the need for expanding the use of appropriate stand 
adjustments and rejuvenation techniques (Anteneh et al. 2008). However, in doing so it is essential to 
take the utmost care in due time not to spread the infestation of coffee wilt disease, which had recently 
become the most devastating coffee disease in the major coffee production systems of the country. Besides coffee varieties, the use of improved or best agronomic practices has been found to increase 
the rate of stand establishment, coffee yield and quality performances both under on-station and on-
farm conditions.

==== CHUNK ====

Above all, the land race  coffee varieties and their multiplication and distribution 
initiative depicted an encouraging achievements in the major coffee growing areas of the country. The available coffee research findings were identified in the development strategy for their rapid 
scaling- up at specific agro-ecology and production system in the country.

==== CHUNK ====

These include suitable 
coffee varieties or adaptable local coffee types, nursery management, plant density, pruning and 
training, rejuvenation methods, water harvesting and conservation, soil fertility management, 
application of plant nutrients and control of coffee pests, harvesting and processing methods, among 
others (Alemseged et al., 2015). The pre-scaling up of coffee nursery and field management practices 
carried out around coffee research centers in Jimma, Illubabor, West Wellega and Kelem Welega 
zones on a total of 120 farmers (JARC, 2015) showed promising results and evidenced the high 
demand by coffee farmers for improved technologies at all the intervention areas.

==== CHUNK ====

The use of best management practices is also equally important to maximize the genetic yield and 
quality potential of coffee varieties and landraces. In effect, there is adequate applied research 
findings in the areas of coffee seed preparation and nursery management and modern and forest coffee 
field management that have been recommended for the different coffee growing areas of the country 
(Yacob et al. 1996; Anteneh et al. 2008; Endale et al. 2008).

==== CHUNK ====

Recommendations on the use of 
prominent coffee shade trees, population density, soil moisture conservation and small-scale irrigation 
schemes, soil fertlity and  nutrient management, cropping patterns, control of coffee pests (weeds, 
insects and diseases) as well as use of best pre- and post-harvest management technologies (IAR 
1996) should be demonstrated and scaled-out to incease coffee productivity and keep the inherent 
quality profiles (Desse 2008) of each area in the country.

==== CHUNK ====

The impacts of important pre- and post- harvest technologies to enhance coffee quality, the 
contribution of technical recommendation provided at every stage of production in the different agro-
ecologies have been reviewed (Behailu et al. 2008b). However, information reaching farmers on 
effluent mangement in wet processing is inadequate. There is a great need in organizing small-scale 
farmers and promoting coffee cooperatives and unions, supporting large-scale private investors, 
intensifying training services,  knowledge  sharing and capacity building among coffee supply value-
chains actors.

==== CHUNK ====

These, among others,  would help to sustain increased productivity, total production and 
high quality standards and enable the country to successfully compete in the global coffee markets 
and improve export earnings. Moreover, new symptoms of drying have appeared on mature coffee trees, perhaps due to climate 
change and variability that has resulted in physiological disorders between vegetative and 
reproductive growth. This may be associated with continuous flowering and heavy crop loads due to 
changes in weather patterns with erratic rainfalls.

==== CHUNK ====

The situation is aggravated by the outbreak of insect 
pests and diseases, requiring new solutions to revive arabica gene pools from possible fast and 
irreversible losses. Thus, multiple site conservation, utilization and management of arabica coffee 
populations by supporting the complementary use of in-situ and ex-situ approaches is important for 
national breeding program and development of the coffee sector. Achievements and Prospects of Coffee Research in Ethiopia: A Review

Coffee Technology Promotion  
In coffee, various technology transfer mechanisms are employed to promote wide use of improved 
technologies across the country rapidly. These include demonstration sites, supplying improved seeds 
and seedlings, training and advisory services, field-days, farmers’ research group, partners’ council 
meetings, publications, on-air, etc. Among which, multiplication and distribution of improved 
planting materials is the major option. According to Taye et al. (2012), neither private nor public 
enterprises are engaged in producing and trading certified coffee seeds and seedlings.

==== CHUNK ====

And there is an 
acute shortage of coffee seeds and seedlings, hampering scaling-up of successful technologies in the 
country. For this, suitable and adaptable coffee technologies should be widely demonstrated and 
transferred to the end users across the country. However, there is still lack of apropriate technologies 
had been the major bottleneck problem hidering rapid expansion of modern and/or semi-commercial 
coffee production system in the country. There should be active collaboration to create access to 
inputs and including seeds and seedlings.

==== CHUNK ====

The results indicate that the demand for coffee seed 
significantly surpasses the supply from coffee research centers and the gap is increasing from year to 
year. Despite the increasing mismatch, an integrated informal and formal coffee system is lacking at 
regional and national levels, which calls for government support for authorizing and establishing 
coffee seed system in the country. The Jimma Research Centre (JRC) is the only public institution that had taken the initiative of 
multiplying and supplying basic coffee seeds, from 1979-2016/17 a total amount of 258.2 ton seeds  
of the released CBD resistant and adaptable varieties were produced and distributed.

Nonetheless, the 
limited endeavor of the JRC has played a considerable role for dissemination and adopation of 
improved coffee technologies by innovative famers, private and state owned farms throughout the 
country. Taye et al. (2012) reported the experiences coffee stakeholders in production and supply of 
improved basic coffee seeds and seedlings. Moreover, a total of 22 seed orchards and 18 farmers’ research-extension groups were established as 
future coffee seed sources awaiting for urgent action to be accredited as legal seed producers at each locality.

Despite their significant yield advantages, the hybrid coffee varieties remained shelved till the 
implementation of the research for development approach of the EIAR in 1998 (Behailu et al., 2008a). between 2015 - 2018 About 26,800 hybrid coffee seedlings were produced and distributed to the 
target areas of the Jimma and Kafa and Iluababora zones. Wondyifraw et al. (2008) reviewed the 
historical background of large-scale clonal propagation of coffee through tissue culture and the status 
of protocol optimization efforts for in vitro propagation of Ethiopian coffee hybrids.

The preliminary 
results from the ex-vitro acclimatization and hardening-off activities were so encouraging to warrant 
subsequent commercialization of the technology. 3.

CONSTRAINTS AND CHALLENGES  
 
Limited or lack of improved technologies with regard to coffee varieties (both pure lines and 
hybrids), agronomic practices, soil and water management, crop protection, coffee processing and 
quality improvement for the different coffee growing agro-ecological zones and for specific 
potential localities in the country; 
 
Lack of technology package recommendations for known coffee brands and specific niches; 
 
Inadequate capacity of technology multiplication for example, multiplication of seeds and 
seedlings of improved coffee varieties; 
 
Less research focus on the relationship between improved technologies and coffee quality; 
 
Limited research in integrated approaches to prevent and control coffee diseases and pests; 
 
Less attention given to participatory research approach and stakeholders involvement, while 
developing technologies; 
 
Less appreciation given to farmer’s indigenous knowledge on disease and pest management, 
landrace development, soil and water management practices; 
 
Less attention given to detailed characterization and sustainable conservation and utilization of 
natural resources and diversification approach in the coffee based farming systems of the country; 
 
Inadequate research fund, laboratory and field facilities, trial sites and trained human power to 
strengthen national coffee research program;

FUTURE RECOMMENDATIONS  
 
Coffee research activities should be extended to uncovered areas in the different coffee growing 
agro-ecologies of the country; 
 
Coffee research should focus on package technology generation with farmers’ participatory 
approach and evaluation before release for each specific locality/ niche and farming/production 
system; 
 
All research activities and technologies should give due emphasis to coffee quality as a major 
priority for each agro-ecology; 
 
Coffee research should focus on extensive collection, characterization and maintenance of coffee 
genetic resource and enhance genetic diversity in each coffee growing agro-ecology; 
 
Modern coffee improvement technologies such as biotechnology (tissue culture and molecular 
characterization and marker assisted selections) should be strengthened; 
 
Research should be strengthened in crop protection /coffee disease and pest management/ and 
Development of location specific CBD resistant cultivars and multiple diseases resistance 
including coffee wilt and leaf rust) as long-term solution.

==== CHUNK ====

There is  a need to strengthen laws and 
regulations for coffee wilt disease management (sanitation and quarantine), extensive training to 
the farmers in uncovered areas and strengthen the epidemiological studies; 
 
Detail characterization studies on nutrient status of coffee soils, soil and plant sample test-based 
fertilizer recommendation, integrated nutrient management along with identification of 
appropriate source of nutrients and compost accelerating methods for organic fertilizer options; 
 
Develop soil-coffee -climate interactions database, soil erosion control studies, coffee-water 
requirement, develop package technologies for irrigated coffee production (ecophysiological 
investigations) in view of climate change; 
 
Due attention should be given to farmers’ indigenous knowledge of disease, pest, soil and water 
management and others, while designing/planning research activities for each coffee growing 
agro-ecology; 
 
Strengthen policy research for the use of waste management, post harvest and value addition 
research (both primary and finished products) need priority; 
 
Technology multiplication capacity (e.g.

==== CHUNK ====

multiplication of seeds and seedlings of improved coffee 
varieties) should be improved via encouraging private investors with the view to meet the 
prevailing demand of all stakeholders; 
 
Coffee diversification research should focus on economically feasible and market oriented 
cropping systems, which also ensure food security, biodiversity conservation, agroforestry and 
ecosystem sustainability; 
 
Skilled human power, facilities and budget should be fulfilled for the National Coffee Research 
Program in order to be competitive in supplying quality coffee in sufficient quantity to the world 
market as demanded; 
 
National coffee funds (levies, taxes, sales, etc) should be established/secured from GOs, NGOs 
and relevant private stakeholders to promote the coffee sector and maintain natural resources, for 
biodiversity and friendly ecosystem services; and 
 
There is a need to strengthen the research system by establishing reliable coffee database and 
networking systems with the relevant local, regional, and international institutions.

There is also a 
strong need for technology shopping to save resources, and gain research experiences from other 
coffee growing countries. REFERENCES
