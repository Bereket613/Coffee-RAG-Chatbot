Abstract—Coffee plants are woody evergreens that can reach 
a height of up to ten meter’s in the wild with the fruit of coffee 
beans, which are the seeds that produce the majority of the 
world’s coffee. This study focuses on a variety of Arabica Coffee 
leaf diseases that occurs frequently in Ethiopia. The diseases 
which occurred primarily are Miner coffee leaf disease (MCLD), 
Rust coffee leaf disease (RCLD), Cercospora coffee leaf disease 
(CCLD), and Phoma coffee leaf disease (PCLD). The study focuses 
on the identification of those four a variety of diseases through 
image processing as well as machine learning mechanisms through 
Transfer learning and convolution neural network (CNN) 
architectures through the feed-forward model, resnet50 model, 
inceptionV3 model, and deep learning model through tenser flow, 
which are the most popular models to detect various plant diseases 
with high Accuracy. All the pictures used for this study were 
captured from the whole state of Ethiopia in every place where 
coffee plant exists. The total number of data sets currently used 
is 58,546 with 80 percent being put to use for training, while the 
rest 20 percent were employed for testing, with a 99.9%, 98.5%, 
99%, and 99% respectively with a total success rate in 
classification accuracy and 99.8%, 98%, 99% and 99.7% 
respectively with total success rate in confusion matrix accuracy. 
So there is excellent performance in inferences. 
 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Coffee is grown in most parts of the world including Africa, 
among African countries Ethiopia produces a high amount 
of coffee. As a result, the agricultural industry plays a vital 
role in both countries’ economic and social life of the people. 
Almost 85 percent of the population in the country is based 
on agricultural inputs and products. Approximately half of 85 
percent of this industry with a contribution of from coffee 
plantation [1] [5]. As I observed for a long period, Ethiopian 
coffee product is the most expensive in the market among other 
countries’ coffee product due to their being purely organic and 
having a uniquely delicious flavor. So every country purchased 
it at any time anywhere they got. Because of this reason, 
Ethiopia is known for the origin of coffee and it has a very high 
quantity and quality of coffee products. Coffee farming in the 
country contributed nearly a quarter of the governmental year 
of revenue. More than half of the population’s economical life 
Is based on coffee plants, either by farming or by shopping 
and trading in every state of the country as well as across 
foreign countries [2]. As we know there are different varieties 
of coffee in most parts of the world as well as in Africa, 
and Ethiopia. But Ethiopian coffee is Coffee-Arabica type 
which is something especial that grows within the whole states 
within the following proportion. Around 63 percent of the 
coffees are produced from Oromia state and 34 percent of 
the coffee in southern nation nationalities of peoples of 
Ethiopia with lesser amounts in Amhara state and the state of 
Gambelia as well as from Drie-Dawa administrative city [2]. 
To sum up, the majority of Ethiopian coffee-Arabica plants are 
grown at an elevation range of one thousand and two thousand 
meters. The Coffee-Arabica is an indigenous African genus 
(species) with several classifications found in the whole part 
of Africa without south and north parts of the continent [3]. Due 
to coffee plant infection problems as well as worldwide 
increasing of temperature influences, in recent years, two 
varieties of coffee plants are available for commercial purposes 
as well as economically grown in every part of the world, those 
are Canephora Coffee (Robusta) which grows in wetlands parts 
of the world and Arabica Coffee (Arabica) that are 
manufactured in uplands of Africa. These interesting classes 
of coffee Arabica category were invented in Ethiopia, particu- 
larly in the area of Kaffa, Southern Nations, and Nationalities 
peoples of Ethiopia. Yemeni merchants spread Arabica coffee 
throughout the whole continent at the time of the fiftieth 
century. In the southwest and southeast of Ethiopia, less a 
number in tropical rain forests that yield coffee plants in a wide 
variety of shadow bushes (trees) [3]. The type of disease which 
occurs in coffee Arabica is a disease like other Coffee Plants 
diseases that damages the leaf, stem, and root of coffee plants. 
As it showed from year to year Coffee plant infections have 
become a major issue in recent years which occurs around the 
stem, root, and coffee beans and leaves. But most of the time 
it occurs on leaves and its productivity decrees in quantity as 
well as quality, [1] [5]. 
II. RELATED WORKS 
 
In research [12], the author focus on trustable predictions and 
metrics of a confusion matrix for rankings of web services by 
applying fuzzy rules to make better binary classification 
improved the effect by arranging the several circumstances 
of consumers’ reaction. In research [4] [5], the authors used 
segmentation technique, filtering methods, and feature extrac- 
tion based on inputting the infected images. Means taking 
as input coffee disease and Pre-processing the image. They 
used for minimizing noise by applying filtering methods and 
Classification to classify dataset with respective class. In re- 
search [6], the researchers used a sequential model as network 
architecture to classify datasets with the technique of Mini- 
Batch Gradient Descent (MBGD) which is the optimization 
algorism to update parameters. Means to add or minus with a 
specified function and data argumentation for improvement of 
generalizability of the model. They also used transfer learning 
as a methodology for the uses of a pre-trained neural network 
to gain knowledge at the time of training one dataset to be 
used on other datasets and Categorical cross-entropy for losing 
functions to evaluate the performance in the model. In research 
[7], the authors were focused on creating a knowledge-based 
system by extracting knowledge of experts to make rules using 
decision tree methods and image processing. Images are 
given as input and prepossessing the image to minimize low 
frequency, background noise, reflection, and masking portion 
of the images to get good accuracy. They also used median 
filtering to eliminate noise and image segmentation for 
understanding of disease identification as a good technique. In 
research [4] Even if there are many techniques, they only use 
K-means segmentation techniques due to no single segmen- 
tation technique being appropriate to all image processing 
applications. They also applied feature mining (removal or 
extract) technique for decreasing the size of a data set by 
evaluating attributes to identify coffee plant disease. They also 
used texture features like GLCM (energy, entropy, con- trast, 
homogeneity, correlation, shade, prominence) and Color 
features. In research [8], the authors used back propagation 
algorithm with the descending gradient method to reduce the 
error function by adjusting the network weights, for their entire 
work they evaluating different approaches based on deep 
learning for the problem of segmentation, classification, and 
quantification of biotic stress of coffee leaves. In research [9], 
the researchers used computational methods as like GLCM 
such as energy, correlation, contrast, and homogeneity as well 
as local binary pattern and deep learning to detect Cercospora 
and Rust coffee plant disease. In general in the past related 
works, most of the researcher works are related and the type 
of accuracy they got also good enough which is between 75- 97 
percent, their accuracy is different according to the type of 
model, performance measure and dataset they have used. But 
they are limited with specific method as well as limited number 
of coffee leaf plant disease and limited number of datasets. 
III. PROBLEM STATEMENT 
• Predicting Coffee Arabica leaf disease such as Miner 
coffee leaf disease (MCLD), Rust coffee leaf disease 
(RCLD), Cercospora coffee leaf disease (CCLD), and 
Phoma coffee leaf disease (PCLD). 
• Develop and design coffee leaf plant diseases identifica- 
tion system through image processing as well as machine- 
learning mechanisms with a high accuracy. 
• Measure the status of the techniques in terms of perfor- 
mance. 
A. Evaluation Metrics 
• Classification accuracy 
• Confusion Matrix 
– Precision 
– Recall 
– F1-score 
– Accuracy 
B. Methods 
• Convolution neural network (CNN) 
• Classification 
• Augmentation 
• Filtering 
• Background removal 
1) CNN: is a type of artificial Neural network that used to 
solve a high range of pattern recognition problem, including 
speech recognition, computer visions, coffee grading and so 
on [10] [11]. The primary point behind convolution neural 
networks is to create a model efficiently with max-pooling 
operation and exceptional convolution for the identification of 
health related issues [13]. So convolution neural networks are 
very fruit-full through the help of convolutional layers and 
other machine-learning methods. 
2) Filtering: It learns to detect coffee disease when trained 
in image classifier [10]. 
3) Data augmentation: is used when there aren’t sufficient 
pieces of training data to include a wide range of image 
categorization scenarios, the convolutional neural network is 
prone to overfitting. As a result, we employ a method so- called 
data augmentation to overcome the over fitting. Through 
numerous transformations like scaling’s, rotations, and con- 
trast changes, data augmentation is helped to generate fresh 
pieces of training of a sample from an existing piece of the 
training set. So by generating more data samples we can 
observe better performances of the model. 
4) Background removal: it is used to reduce noise as well 
as used to concentrate on the infected areas, besides this, it is 
used to detect the front and the backside of the image. 
5) Confusion Matrix: It is expressed in the form of a table to 
measure the performance as a classifier through precision, 
recall, and f1-score based on test data by taking true values. So 
to use the confusion matrix we have to know some important 
terms which are:- 
• True positive(TP) 
TP +FP 
TP +FN 
1+e 
• False Positive(FP) 
• True Negative(TN) 
• False Negative(FN) 
So, to elaborate on those terms let us take a Rust leaf disease- 
infected coffee into the consideration of binary classification. 
• A coffee which was actually infected (positive) and 
classified as infected (positive). This is a True positive. 
• A coffee which was not actually infected (negative) and 
classified as not infected (negative). This is a true 
negative. 
• A coffee which was not actually infected (negative) and 
classified as infected (positive). This is a false positive. 
• A coffee which was actually infected (positive) and clas- 
sified as not infected (negative). This is a false positive. 
6) Precision: is a performance metric that indicates the 
number of positive forecasts that were correct. 
The formula of Precision: 
Precision =    T P 
 
7) Recall: is a performance metric that indicates a number 
of the positive cases the classifier appropriately predicted. The 
formula of Recall: 
Recall =    T P      
 
8) F1-score: The combination harmonic mean effect of 
recall and precision is called F1-score. 
The formula of F1-score: 
F 1 − score = 2∗Precision∗Recall   =            2∗TP 
 
Very important point is kernel size, it depends on the inputs 
image, if our inputs image is higher than 128×128 we should 
select to use a kernel size more than 3 which helps us to 
learn bigger spatial filter as well as to decrease the sizes of 
the volume. Unless use less than or equal to 3. 
2) Max Pooling: is a feature of map merging operations that 
determines the highest values for patches. The features maps’ 
dimensions are reduced by using max-pooling layers. As a 
result, the number of parameters to acquire (learning) and the 
number of images processing in the networks are both reduced. 
The feature contained in a section of the features map produced 
by convolutional layers is summed up by the max- pooling 
layer. See the colored table 1 below.

C. Model Layers 
2∗TP +FP +FN 
From CNN due to necessary parts of its convolutional oper- 
ations. The goal of using the relu’s activation function is to 
make our pictures more non-linear. The reason behind this is 
that pictures are non-linear by nature. 
4) Dense layer : is the simplest layer of a neuron in which 
1) Keras Conv2D: 2D Convolutions Layers which is a 
fundamental component of CNN architectures with a wide 
range of applications and produces tensors of output by wind- 
ing a convolutions kernel with the layer input. Even if there 
are several parameters, The compulsory conv2D parameter 
is the number of filters from which the convolution layer will 
learn, which is a numeral value as well as controls the number 
of outputs filter in the convolutions Which follows three 
important steps listed below. 
• K kernels waiting’s till applies to the images 
• Every kernel is convoluted with the volume of the inputs 
• The outputs of every convoluted operation create a ”2D” 
outputs known as an ”activation map” 
As everyone noted in the Fig.1 below as your result 
spatial 
Every neuron received inputs from all the other neurons of back 
layers which are used in convolutions layers outputs for 
classifying images. 
5) Flatten: is the process of turning data into a one- 
dimensional array for use in the next layers and used to 
construct features of vectors which is a single lengthy output of 
convolution layer will be flatted, As a result, it will be 
connected fully with the last classifications of the model. 
6) Soft max: is served for multi classification problem 
which is beneficial since it translates the outputs of our neural 
network of the most end layers into what is effectively a 
probability distribution. So as I had five classes I used soft max 
at the end layer as a classifier. 
Soft max for multi-class single label classification. 
 
Volume is reducing your amount of filter learning will be rising 
Which is a very major exercise at the time of designation of 
CNN architecture as well as it is better to do selecting the 
correct amount of filter with the power of two with value and 
you defiantly want to tune the correct values based on the 
involvedness of your datasets as well as the deepness of your 
NN, but it should be between ranges of [32, 64, 128] and 
[256, 512, 1024] from initial to the deepest layer. The other 
Sigmoid for single-label/multi-label binary classification. 
σ(z) = 
1−z 
7) Dropout: is not exactly a layer rather it is a method for 
preventing over fitting in a model. 
8) Batch-normalization: is a method that helps to nor- 
malize contribution for the layers to each mini bach during 
training in deep NN.

IV. DATASET 
Publically no datasets were available on this study from 
past researchers. Some of the datasets were available but they 
are less in number, has noise problem and background is not 
removed. There were private data sets that I had received 
that were taken through the expert of agricultural people 
using digital cameras with different sizes and needed further 
enhancements such as annotations with proper label names and 
file extensions, cropping, and other necessary preprocessing 
things. Those dataset were only from the leaf of Coffee 
Arabica type and has the overall of five classes with one 
class healthy Coffee leaf(HCL) and the other four classes are 
infected with the various coffee disease with a total number of 
58,546 coffee leaf images which split into train and test in the 
ratio of 80 to 20 percent. Purposely I had used two types of 
datasets to now the effect of background noise and to check 
the proper inference of the model. 
• Dataset with proper enhancement with a total number of 
58546 images. 
• Dataset without proper enhancement with a total number 
of 1008 images. 
Here is below a sample dataset visualization for both type of 
datasets that we can refer in Fig 2 and 3 respectively.

A. Class wise distribution of dataset images 
The number of times each class appears in each image in 
a dataset is quantified by the Distribution of Class Frequency 
per Image. This statistic shows the frequency and distribution 
of various classes across the dataset, illuminating the class 
heterogeneity among various photos. For results refer Fig. 4

V. EXPERIMENT 
Experiment is done through four models namely the feed 
forwarded model using CNN, Resnet50 model, InceptionV3 
model, and Deep learning model through the tenser flow to 
predict and develop coffee leaf plant disease through image 
processing as well as machine-learning mechanisms. So in this 
experiment, I used both the performance measure metrics such 
as classification accuracy and confusion matrix accuracy. 
1) Feed forwarded Model: In this model, each input was 
entered into the layers. Then multiplied by weights and every 
value should be added together to obtain a summation of the 
weighted input values. For results refer Fig. 5, 6 and 7

A. Probability Distribution 
It is a function that shows the probabilities of each likely 
event for a given random variable. To put it another way, it 
describes the range of possible event frequencies. For results

VII. CONCLUSIONS AND COMPARISON OF MODELS 
To conclude the performance metrics of confusion matrix 
accuracy are much better than the performance metrics of 
classification accuracy and among the four models used in this 
study feed forwarded model achieves 99.8% accuracy. Another 
core idea in this study is, that if we have imbalanced data points 
then the confusion matrix is the best one. For more see the table 
below named a Comparison of models.
