Abstract: Ethiopia is believed to be the birth place of Arabica coffee and coffee takes a lion share in Ethiopian economy and 
socio-economic development since it is a prime export commodity in the country. Cognizant of its importance, Ethiopian 
government made key development plan and strategies to increase coffee production and productivity.

==== CHUNK ====

As a result, many efforts 
were made in coffee research and extension in the last five decades; but so far Ethiopia has not attained to fully capitalize its 
potential in the coffee sector and there is no information on change over years of production and productivity of coffee. FAOSTAT and International Coffee Organization data were used and analyzed by descriptive statistics. Descriptive results 
depicted that even if coffee productivity is not significantly increased in the last decades, coffee production increased from 
around 180,000 metric ton in 1993 to 487,808.44 metric ton in 2021.

==== CHUNK ====

However, still Ethiopia left behind in coffee production as 
compared to the major world coffee producing countries and its contribution to global coffee production is less than 5% over 
several years. To change and improve the historical growth trend of coffee production and productivity, it is the responsibility 
of all stakeholders to support coffee producers to use full package of recommended production technologies and to stump old 
coffee trees and work on soil and water conservation practices. Keywords: Coffee, Productivity, Production, Trend Analysis

Introduction 
Arabica coffee is origin to Ethiopia and it plays a pivotal 
role in the socio-economic development of Ethiopia and the 
rest of the word where coffee is produced and imported 
respectively. In Ethiopia, Coffee accounts for 2-3% of the 
gross domestic products (GDP), 29% of total national export 
(average of the last 10 years) and about 37% of the total 
agricultural export revenue. Furthermore, a total of 4.7 
million small-holders directly involved in coffee production, 
and about 25 million people directly or indirectly depend on 
the sub-sector for their livelihoods.

==== CHUNK ====

Beyond deep-rooted 
attachment of coffee and the Ethiopian community and its 
multitude importance to Ethiopia and the world at large, 
Ethiopia is the world’s oldest exporter of coffee that predates 
1830 [1]. The main coffee producing regional states in Ethiopia are 
Oromia and SNNP contributing 69% and 29% respectively to 
national production, and the contribution of other regions is 
1% and together they contribute to Ethiopian coffee 
production [2]. Ethiopian coffee has unique flavors that make 
it competent in international market and highly demanded in 
developed countries.

==== CHUNK ====

Accordingly, they are classified as 
Spicy for Sidama coffee, Winy for Limu coffee, Fruity for 
Nekemte Coffee, Floral for Yirgachefe Coffee and Mocha for 
Harar Coffee [3]. Ethiopian coffee is characterized by different production 
system such as forest coffee (10%), semi forest coffee (35%), 
plantation for about15% (5% government, 10% private), 
garden coffee (35%) and 5% others [3, 14]. However, 
recently, some authors are arguing that there are more than 
the specified coffee production systems in Ethiopia. There 
are about 35 pure lines and 9 hybrids coffee varieties with 
respective recommended management practices in Ethiopia.

==== CHUNK ====

In the country, 95% of coffee production is grown by 
smallholder farmers and it is inter-cropped with cereals, 
 
Research & Development 2023; 4(4): 139-142

fruits, ensets and vegetables, mainly in the southern and 
eastern regions. Coffee in other producer countries such as 
Brazil and Viet Nam, in contrast, is mainly plantation or 
estate cultivated, with fewer varieties [4].

==== CHUNK ====

Ethiopia ranks first 
in Africa and 5th in the world in coffee production and 
FAOSTAT data of 2021 indicate that, the total area under 
cultivation of coffee in Ethiopia is estimated at 685,294 
hectares with average productivity of 0.71t/ha, but the 
country ranked tenth in the world in coffee exports with 
about 4.45 percent of the global export market share. 2. Coffee Production Status in Ethiopia

Current Coffee Productivity Status and Trends in 
Ethiopia: Comparisons with Major Coffee Producing 
Countries of the World 
Over several years, cognizant of its importance, 
government of Ethiopia had made many efforts to strengthen 
the coffee sub-sector through establishing organizations 
responsible for coffee development and research. Besides the 
efforts made by different development organizations, Coffee 
Research Station was established which is now called Jimma 
Agricultural Research Center (JARC), at Jimma in late 1967 
to backup coffee development endeavors with technical 
assistance in Ethiopia [1, 13].

==== CHUNK ====

Since then, JARC has made a 
significant contribution to the growth and development of 
coffee sector by delivering improved coffee technologies, 
knowledge and information to enhance coffee production and 
productivity in the country. Through the big efforts made 
about 35 pure lines and 9 hybrids coffee varieties with 
average productivity potential of 1.1-2.3t/ha and 2-2.6t/ha 
respectively were developed and available for specific agro-
ecology of Ethiopia. Despite big efforts and huge 
investments made on coffee research and extension, 
Ethiopian coffee productivity remains low which is on 
average between the range of 0.5t/ha to 0.7t/ha from the year 
1993-2021 [5].

==== CHUNK ====

However, Ethiopian coffee yield/ha is still 
better than other African coffee producing countries such as 
Kenya, Rwanda, and Tanzania, but significantly lower than 
many Latin American producers [15]. Figure 1. Coffee productivity in Ethiopia and comparison to the rest major world producing countries ((t/ha). Figure 1 indicates, in Ethiopia, coffee productivity reflects 
static growth from 1993-2021 with an average value of 
0.7t/ha and an increase in coffee production in the last three 
decades comes mainly from both area expansion and the 
good agro-ecology of the country [6].

==== CHUNK ====

Low productivity of 
coffee in Ethiopia is said to be caused by a combination of 
several factors such as natural calamities such as land 
degradation, poor soil and water conservation practices, and 
disease, demographic factors, socio-economic factors, weak 
extension services, lack of stumping old coffee trees, 
production system and lack of knowledge on the efficient 
utilization of available technologies, lack of access to basic 
agricultural inputs like fertilizer, chemicals such as 
herbicides and fungicides [7-10]. However, from 2018 
onwards, the government of Ethiopia has started different 
initiative to increase coffee production and productivity in 
the country.

==== CHUNK ====

Stumping old age coffee trees and uprooting and 
replanting and cluster farming are among some of the recent 
government initiatives implemented to increase coffee 
production and productivity in Ethiopia. 2.2. Current Coffee Production Status, Trends and the 
Share of Ethiopia in Global Coffee production 
In the year of 1990-2019, world coffee production showed 
a significant increasing trend with remarkable fluctuation and 
from 1990 to 2019, total coffee production has increased by 
176.8% globally from 5.6 million MT to 9.9 million MT.

==== CHUNK ====

The 
major reasons responsible for this remarkable global coffee 
production increase were, almost all of the most important 
coffee producers (Brazil, Colombia, Indonesia, Ethiopia, etc.) 
have increased their production. On the other hand, Vietnam 
as a new world power has appeared in the global map of 
coffee 
production 
increasing 
its 
coffee 
production 
significantly in the period 1990-2019 [5, 11, 12] and 
141 
Efrem Asfaw:  Review: Ethiopian Coffee Production Status and Trend Analysis: Comparison with Major Coffee  
 
Producing Countries of the World 
nowadays, Vietnam is the second most important coffee 
producer of the world with 30.5 million bags in 2019.

==== CHUNK ====

By the same trend, as indicated in figure 2, in the year of 
1993-2021, 
Ethiopian 
coffee 
production 
showed 
an 
increasing trend with fluctuations over the years. In the years 
specified, total coffee production in the country has increased 
by 171% that is from 180,000 MT in 1993 to 487,808.44 
million MT in 2021 [5]. In Ethiopia, even if coffee 
productivity shows constant growth trends, remarkable 
increase in coffee production over years comes mainly from 
both area expansion and the good agro-ecology of the 
country [5].

==== CHUNK ====

From 2010 onwards, there is a significant coffee 
production growth and the year from 2010-2019 was a period 
when Agricultural Growth Program (AGP) was implemented 
in Ethiopia in which coffee sector was supported to increase 
its production and productivity. Figure 2. Coffee production in Ethiopia and comparison to the rest major world producing countries (MT). In line with the remarkable overall growth of global coffee 
production, the concentration of the major producers has also 
increased dramatically.

==== CHUNK ====

As Figure 3 shows, the share of top 
three producers (in 2019; Brazil, Vietnam and Colombia) 
was 62.28%, while the share of the Indonesia and Ethiopia 
was around 13% and the share of Ethiopia alone was 4.45%. From the years 1993-2021, the share of Ethiopia to world 
coffee production was increased from 3.12% to 4.45% with 
42.6% increment over the years. It should, however, be noted 
here that while Ethiopia is the largest coffee producer and 
exporter in Africa, its contribution to global coffee 
production is significantly low as compared mainly to Latin 
American countries.

==== CHUNK ====

Figure 3 depicted that during 2019, 
Brazil rank first in coffee export (35.27%) followed by 
Vietnam (18.47%), Colombia (8.54%), and Indonesia (6.93%) 
of world coffee production. Figure 3. Coffee production shares of top producing countries (1990-2019). 3. Conclusion and Recommendation 
In Ethiopia, coffee production is increasing over years and 
this increasing trend is assumed to be due to area expansion 
and good agro-ecology of the country. However, despite 
wide opportunity of coffee production, so far Ethiopia has 
not attained to fully capitalize its potential in the coffee 
sector.

==== CHUNK ====

Trend analysis result of three decades available data 
depicted that smallholder farmer’s coffee productivity in 
Ethiopia is very low which is on average 0.7t/ha. However, 
Ethiopian coffee yield/ha is still better than other African 
coffee producing countries such as Kenya, Rwanda, and 
Tanzania, but significantly lower than many Latin American 
producers.

==== CHUNK ====

Low productivity of coffee in Ethiopia is said to 
be caused by a combination of several factors: natural

calamities such as land degradation, poor soil and water 
conservation practices, and disease, demographic factors, 
socio-economic factors, weak extension services, lack of 
stumping old coffee trees, production system and lack of 
knowledge 
on 
the 
efficient 
utilization 
of 
available 
technologies, lack of access to basic agricultural inputs like 
fertilizer, chemicals such as herbicides and fungicides.

==== CHUNK ====

However, from 2018 onwards, the government of Ethiopia 
has started different initiative to increase coffee production 
and productivity in the country. Supporting coffee producers 
to use full package of recommended production technologies 
and to stump old coffee trees and work on soil and water 
conservation practices are therefore, the major pillars seeking 
a due attention to fully exploit potentials of the specific 
coffee producing regions in Ethiopia. References
