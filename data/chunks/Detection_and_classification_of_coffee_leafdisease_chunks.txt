Abstract—Ethiopia is the leading coffee exporter in Africa
which accounts for 22% of the country’s commodity exports.
Coffee is one of the crucial agricultural product in the global
economy, particularly for Ethiopia.

==== CHUNK ====

However, diseases like brown
eye spot, wilt, and rust are the most determinant constraints
the productivity and quality of coffee export. The disease de-
tection requires specific attention from professionals, which is
not achievable for mass production. As a result, an autonomous
method for detecting and classifying coffee plant disease become
very crucial for better productivity.

==== CHUNK ====

To determine whether a
particular image of a leaf has a brown eye spot, wilt, or rust
or if it is healthy, we created a deep learning model trained
with image dataset collected from the Wolaita Sodo agricultural
research center consisting of 1,120 and augmentation technique
also applied to handle data over-fitting problem and totally 3,360
images were used. In order to achieve the best results during
the classification of such diseases, we compared training from
scratch and transfer learning techniques.

==== CHUNK ====

Because of this, training
from scratch performs at a rate of 98.5%, whereas transfer-
based learning offers accuracy rates of 97.01% and 99.89% when
employing transfer learning through Mobilnet and Resnet50,
respectively. The pre-trained Resnet50 model performs picture
classification better than other methods. We are further working
towards considering the other class of the Coffee leaf disease
by incorporating additional data beside the other pre-trained
models.

INTRODUCTION
Agriculture is essential to economic growth; it contributed
4% of the world’s GDP, and in the least developed nations,
it may even make up more than 25% of gross domestic
product (GDP) in the future [1]. Agriculture is also one of
Ethiopia’s top economic sectors which accounts for around
68% of employment and 34% of GDP.

==== CHUNK ====

According to World
Bank1, Agriculture is one of the leading source of income to
reduce poverty, raise incomes and improve food security for
more than 80% of the poor people who live in rural areas and
work mainly in farming for the country like Ethiopia.
Additionally, more than 75% of Ethiopia’s population heav-
ily relies on agriculture to provide for their basic needs.

==== CHUNK ====

Africa
is a continent whose economy mainly relies on agriculture.
Accordingly, for a nation like Ethiopia, the requirement for
agricultural economic growth is rising at an alarming rate.
Over the past decades, the demand of economic growth on
1https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/agriculture/overview
agricultural center is increasing in an exponential rate. Thus,
the rate of generation within the agriculture sector has doubled
within the recent two decades [2], [3]. This resulted within
the extension of land, labour and expansion worker close to
the modern inputs for the agriculture sector.

==== CHUNK ====

In like manner,
the production of crops in final decade becomes three times
more than that of the year 2017 whereas the demand delivered
increased by 86% for an increase of the 70% area cultivated.
Among the agricultural products, Coffee is one of the
crucial agricultural product in the global economy, particularly
for Ethiopia [4]. In addition, many people uses Coffee as a
refreshment and source of income beside the cultural value
[5]. Ethiopia is the biggest maker of coffee in Africa and
is the fifth biggest coffee maker within the world another to
Brazil, Vietnam, Colombia, and Indonesia of add up to world
coffee generation.

==== CHUNK ====

Being the beginning of coffee Arabica,
Ethiopia has gigantic potential to offer the world showcase
a wide assortment of flavours of naturally delivered, washed
and sun-dried coffee. Present days, Ethiopia is contributing
approximately 7-10% of add up to world coffee generation [4].
Beside contribution to world coffee market, around 15 million
individuals specifically or in a roundabout way, determining
their jobs from a coffee framework in Ethiopia [5].
Even though area and demand increased, efficiency re-
mained low because of a variety of issues, including disease-
related harm, subpar management techniques, sterile soil, and
cheap prices [6].

==== CHUNK ====

Diseases that are increasing in frequency
as a result of environmental factors, economic factors, poor
management, and hereditary factors are also linked to the low
price of coffee [7]. Three principal diseases, Coffee Leaf Rust,
Coffee Brown Eye Spot Disease, and Coffee Berry Disease,
affect the coffee plant for different reasons [8]. Since it is a
fact that plants can contract diseases, it is also very important
for farmers to be aware of these problems [11].

==== CHUNK ====

Plant disease
is one of the main factors that affects plant quality and can
destroy the entire field’s crops, generating an impressive resign
incident within a few days after the initial damage manifests
itself in the cultivate.
In today’s world, the introduction of soft-computing tech-
nologies has provided a platform for plant profession-
als/pathologists to employ more intelligent tools and method-
ologies to diagnose and treat recognized plant leaf diseases, as
well as identify and categorize crop leaf illnesses [11], [12].

So, with the aforesaid issue of soft computing technology, it
is necessary to come up with and merge Artificial Intelligence
(AI).

==== CHUNK ====

Currently, machine learning under the umbrella of AI
setups is assisting in overcoming obstacles in each industry.
The majority of agricultural start-ups are adapting the AI-
enabled strategy to increase the efficiency of agricultural out-
put [8]. The automated technique is assisting several segments
to improve efficiency and competence. Similarly, machine
learning in agribusiness is assisting growers to improve their
adequacy while decreasing environmental adverse affects.
Computer vision innovation is widely used in the field of
agricultural computerization as a result of the rapid advance-
ment of artificial intelligence where a computer is made to
observe and perceive.

==== CHUNK ====

Instead of using the human common
eye to detect, track, and degree targets for sophisticated image
processing, this innovation uses an advanced camera and
computer [8]. Because of the development of computer vision,
such innovation is now widely used in the field of agricultural
automation and contributes significantly to its advancement.
A number Image processing helps computer vision to infer
myore significant information from the image input and ma-
chine learning must learn from experience in order to execute
computer vision tasks [8], [12].

==== CHUNK ====

Machine learning enables
frameworks to organically learn and improve from experience
with or without minor unambiguous human impediments, is
necessary for machines to conduct computer vision operations
[13]. It focuses on the development of computer systems that
can gather data and build models to produce better choices
through judgments in agreement with prior views or data
records.
Deep learning is the study of machine learning algorithms
and artificial neural networks that have more than one hidden
layer [14], [15].

==== CHUNK ====

Different layers of neurons in deep learning
accomplish diverse hierarchical learning of the information
representation by means of non-linear changes [8]–[10], as
opposed to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
Therefore, it is frequently need to look closely at the leaf,
stem, and occasionally the tree and perform some preventive
work in order to identify potential reasons of the issue of
a coffee [8], [9]. In a similar manner, conventional methods
are frequently used by experts to prepare identifiable proof
of disease through visual inspection.

==== CHUNK ====

However, due to a lack
of expertise and a large number of ranches, it is tedious,
time-consuming, prone to error, and occasionally not practical
[16]. Consequently, in order to solve those issues, we need a
unique technique. In addition to this, a wide range of visible
indicators, such as colored streaks or patches on various parts
of the plants, can indicate that Coffee is diseased [9], [10].
Continually changing in color, shape, and size as the disease
progresses are the visual symptoms of the illness, which makes
it difficult to track the status.

==== CHUNK ====

Thus, there is a need to detect
and classify Coffee disease automatically.
Therefore, to boost the agricultural fields and the economy
of the nation by raising the productivity and quality of Coffee,
it is necessary to utilize a computerized early disease detection
and classification in a short period by looking at the plant
symptoms in an easier and cheaper way using the state-of-
the-art AI technology which favours the high productivity and
efficiency.
II. RELATED WORKS
Deep learning plays an important role in the agricultural
sector for identifying plant diseases at different stages of
cultivation.

==== CHUNK ====

Numerous studies aimed to automatically identify
and diagnose illness from various parts of the plant in an
effort to address these various problems. This section gives
a thorough explanation of the accomplishment.
The idea of using image processing to automatically identify
the three main diseases affecting Ethiopian coffee leaves were
attempted [11].

==== CHUNK ====

In the study, FCM, Otsu, Gaussian distribution,
K-means, and a combination of Gaussian distribution and
K-means clustering were five segmentation technique used.
The standard traditional characteristics like color, shape, and
texture, which perform badly when used alone, in addition
to the Gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) and color
features to extract features from Ethiopian coffee leaves. The
model was trained using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN),
Nave Bayes, Self Organizing Map (SOM), and Radial Basis
Function (RBF).

==== CHUNK ====

The accuracy is 92.10% when Gaussian
distribution and K-means clustering are combined with a mix
of SOM and RBF classification techniques.
Another effort has been made to gauge the degree of
severity utilizing a mobile phone system that can instantly
recognize and classify Coffee Leaf miner and rust [17]. They
employed k-means clustering, the Otsu Technique, and an
iterative threshold technique over two color spaces (HSV
and YCbCr) to segment the diseased and pest-infested areas
of the coffee leaves from the healthy ones. To train the
model, they used extreme learning machines (ELM), back
propagation neural networks (BPNN), and artificial neural
networks (ANN).

==== CHUNK ====

Finally, ELM outperforms ANN and BPNN
by a small margin.
Beside artificial neural network [18], the traditional machine
learning method that was suggested on a machine vision-based
approach to identify papaya disease is used. Five different
diseases, including black spot, powdery mildew, brown spot,
phytophthora blight, and anthracnose, could be identified and
categorized using Support Vector Machine (SVM) with an
accuracy more than 90%.

==== CHUNK ====

The approach has a problem of de-
tecting automatic illumination feature, back ground clustering
of an objects that have similar appearance, intra-variation and
view point variation.
Furthermore, diagnosis of the vegetable disease and insect
pest recognition were made through the images captured on
smartphones [19]. A new extraction and classification tech-
nique used to distinguish leaves from photographs. A region-
labeling technique was then used to calculate the number of
insects and sick areas in the segmented images. To separate the
objects in the zones of adhesion, a mathematical morphology
approach was used.

==== CHUNK ====

The proposed approach was field-tested
and implemented on mobile smart devices. The experimental
result is 91.96% accurate. The method’s accuracy is limited in
2
some difficult conditions, such as leaf occlusion, color simi-
larity between the object and the leaves, aberrant illumination,
and low image quality.
The study revealed that disease identification and clas-
sification have been routinely done using computer vision,
which has produced quite interesting results in the sector of
agriculture. Deep learning algorithms such as CNN and ANN
are also often used.

==== CHUNK ====

So, a plant that has leaf indications as
well as bacterial leaf wilt, fungal leaf rust, and fungal brown
eye spot, but there is currently a desire to develop a model
that is more correct and effective. In general, more precise
and effective model development is required for a plant with
leaf symptoms such as bacterial leaf wilt, fungal Leaf Rust,
and fungal brown eye spot.

MATERIAL AND METHODS
In this article, we used experimental research to develop a
deep learning model that can identify and categorize Coffee
leaf disease employing a series of step-by-step procedures
from data collection through model creation and evaluation.
Accordingly, Section III-A, presents the detail image data
collection and preparation for experiment while IV presents
the proposed system architecture as part of the study.
A. Data Collection and Preparation
Due to unavailability of sufficient open dataset for Coffee
leaf disease detection and classification, we opted to collect
and prepare a data from Wolaita Sodo agricultural research
in addition to Kaggle2 dataset.

==== CHUNK ====

Deep learning, as opposed to
traditional machine learning, necessitates a vast amount of
data to train the model which might have direct impact on the
experiment. For this, Image data sets is collected with the help
of domain experts such as extension agents, and agricultural
researchers for the aim of training the model. As a result,
a total of 1,120 images from the Wolaita Sodo agricultural
farming sector, Southern Nation and Nationality of People
Region (SNNPR) of Ethiopia. The images dataset collected are
from four different categories. These categories are; healthy
images, images with brown eye spots, images with wilt, and
images with rust.

==== CHUNK ====

The images dataset were taken using mobile-
phone, specifically Samsung A50 camera.
In capturing the Coffee leaf images, we settle the smart-
phone on a stand to diminish hand development and make a
difference to capture uniform. All images were captured in
the same situation of lighting and only single leaf per image.
Only one leaf per shot and the identical lighting conditions
were used for all images.

leaf image collected from onsite for brown eye, leaf rust, leaf

As depicted in Figure 1, the data includes 287 images with
brown eye spots (22 online and 265 onsite), 285 images with
rust (49 online and 236 onsite), 278 images with wilt (72
online and 206 onsite), and 270 images with healthy eyes (46
online and 224 onsite).
After gathering the dataset, the leaf image is subjected
to a number of image-preprocessing tasks, including noise
reduction, resizing, and data splitting, which are considered to
be the most significant and crucial steps when working with
image preparation and processing. Following labeling, data
augmentation were used to add additional images and address
the issue of over-fitting.

PROPOSED SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
Given sufficient data for learning, deep learning techniques
have achieved very high performance in a variety of fields such
as image identification and segmentation, speech recognition,
natural language processing beside the emotion recognition
[14]. We assess the usefulness of deep learning method, which
is the state-of-the-art for digital image processing tasks. Tradi-
tional strategies for training classifiers need explicit extraction
of the features to be studied from the image prior to categoriza-
tion and prediction.

==== CHUNK ====

A deep neural network with specialization
in handling data that has a grid-like representation, such an
image and multi-dimensional data, is known as a convolution
neural network (CNN), also called ConvNet [20], [21]. In
contrast to other networks with fully connected layers, CNN
has profound feed-forward engineering and has incredible
generalizing capacity.
The genuine reality is that CNNs give automatic feature
extraction, which is the essential advantage. The desired input
information is at first sent to a feature extraction network,
and after that the result extracted features are sent to a
classifier network.

==== CHUNK ====

The feature extraction network comprises
loads of convolutional and pooling layer sets. Convolutional
layer comprises of a collection of digital filters to perform the
convolution operation on the input information. The pooling
layer is utilized as a dimensionality decrease layer and chooses
the threshold.
CNN has a numerous hidden layer that mimics and gets it
stimuli as the visual cortex of the brain processes. The output
layer of CNN regularly uses the neural network for multiclass
classification. The more the layer the deeper the network for
better image recognition. The neural network classification
block then works on the premise of the image features and
produces the output.

==== CHUNK ====

The neural network for feature extraction
incorporates convolution layer heaps and sets of pooling
layers. As its name shows, the convolution layer changes the
image utilizing the method of the convolution. Pooling layer
changes the neighboring pixels to a single pixel. Then this
layer decreases the dimension of an image.
A digital image refers to visual data made up of a grid-
like arrangement of pixels, each of which carries a value that
indicates how bright and what color it should be. CNN is made
up of four main departments [23].

==== CHUNK ====

These procedures include
feature extraction from an input, activation functions such the
Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), Sigmoid, and Softmax, pooling,
which reduces the layer size, and dense layers (completely
linked layers), in which each node is connected to every node
on the adjacent levels. In pre-processing, we used median filter
to filter salt and pepper noise on the collected image.

2: CNN architecture adopted and modified from [22]
To collect additional images, address the issue of limited
data, and improve the training and classification model, data
augmentation techniques were used to the original image data
to avoid the data imbalance and data over-fitting problem.
The data augmentation is made using 90 degree rotation and
horizontal flipping the original data. After data augmentation,
the resources are divided in to training and validation. From
the total dataset, 80% of the data used for training while the
remaining 20% of the data are further divided for validation
and testing the classification.

EXPERIMENT AND RESULT DISCUSSION
As part of the experiment result and discussion, the spec-
ification used in the development of the Coffee leaf disease
classification presented in Section V-A, the different hyper-
parameter used in the development beside the experiments
attempted are presented in V-B followed by the detail of
experimental result and discussion under the Section V part.
A. Experimental setup
The experiment was carried out using a PC with an Intel(R)
Core(TM) i7-8550U CPU running at 1.80GHz and 1.99GHz,
8GB RAM, and the Windows 10 Pro operating system.

==== CHUNK ====

Beside
these, different tools have been used for the development of
classification model such as Python, Tensorflow, and Keras.
TensorFlow is a complete open source machine learning
platform which is feature rich, adaptable ecosystem of tools,
libraries, and community resources that enable researchers to
push the boundaries of ML and developers to quickly build and
deploy ML-powered applications [24], [25]. Similarly, Keras
adheres to best practices for lowering cognitive load using
Tensorflow as a backend [24], [25]. It also provides consistent
APIs that reduce the amount of user activities necessary for
typical application.

==== CHUNK ====

On the other hand, Python is a dynamically
typed programming language that is high-level, interpreted,
and general-purpose programming language.
B. Experimental setting
In this part, we modified the experimental setup and as-
sessed and tested the performance of the offered methods in
order to find the best performing approach for our dataset. The
experiment is carried out by contrasting both ways of training
from scratch and transfer learning.

==== CHUNK ====

In transfer learning, the
4
researcher used Residual Network with 50 layer (Resnet50)
and Mobilenet for transfer based learning.
In training from scratch, the researcher used a 224x224
image as an input for training, and the model was built from
fifteen hidden layers consisting of six 2D convolution layers
interspersed with six 2D max-pooling layers, then a flattening
layer, and two dense layers, producing a single array with four
items containing the probability of the image being healthy,
rust, brown eye spot, or wilt leaf. Similarly, in pre-trained
model of ResNet 50 which is the backbone of the network
for the computer vision tasks.

==== CHUNK ====

Mobilenet is a class of CNN
that was open-sourced by Google, and therefore, this gives us
an excellent starting point for training our classifiers that are
insanely small and insanely fast. MobileNets are little, low-
latency, low-power models parameterized to meet the asset
imperatives of assortment of use cases [20].
To explore and build a deep learning model, we chose a
number of epochs equal to 20, a batch size of 32, dropout
is equal to 0.5, loss function of Categorical Cross-Entropy, a
learning rate of 0.001, and a dataset split of 80% for training
and 20% for testing.

==== CHUNK ====

In addition, the adam optimizer, the Relu
activation function, the Softmax classifier, the max pooling,
verbose of one, and the 3 channel RGB image were used.
C. Experiment
In this study, three different deep learning experiment
conducted using Convolutional Neural Network using the
Experimental setup and setting discussed in Section V-A and
Section V-B, respectively. The first experiment is conducted
using training from scratch/baseline without using any pre-
trained model. The result obtained from the experiment shows
a 97.92% test accuracy and 5.25% test loss.

==== CHUNK ====

The training result
shows 97.43% training accuracy with 7.19% training loss.
Unlike the first experiment, the two deep learning algorithm
takes the advantage of pre-trained transfer based to benefit
from sufficient resource for the detection and classification
of Coffee leaf disease. Accordingly, the experiment result
of Resnet50 shows a 99.86% training accuracy and 2.50%
training loss with 99.89% test accuracy and 1.40% test loss.
Similarly, Mobilenet experment achieved a 97.01% training
accuracy and 7.60% training loss with 98.96% test accuracy
and 6.20% test loss.

==== CHUNK ====

The experiment comparison of baseline,
Resnet50 and Mobilenet against the accuracy in training and
testing is presented in Figure 3.
As depicted in Figure 3, the result obtained from the
three experiment using convolutional neural network shows
a promising result despite the small amount of data collected
and used for Coffee leaf disease detection and classification,
this is specially true for the training from scratch. The results
of the leaf disease detection and classification demonstrate
that it is feasible to identify and categorize leaf disease at
the earliest stages of planting in order to maximize output and
implement suitable treatment measures before the condition
worsens.

==== CHUNK ====

Accordingly, the Resnet50 provides an improved
result performance over by 2.85% from the MobileNet while
Fig. 3: Experiment result comparison
1.35% from scratch training.

==== CHUNK ====

This achievement over the train-
ing from scratch and MobileNet is a result of pre-trained
model used to train the data over the large one though the
performance of the MobileNet gets better with higher epoch.
By the same token, training from the scratch has resulted a
better performance by 1.49% over the MobileNet.
Since the performance of the CNN based on Resnet50 pre-
trained performs with a better performance over the two deep
learning, Figure 4 presents the performance and loss measure
of the testing and validation of the Resnet50.
Fig.

Resnet50
As depicted in Figure 4, the performance of test accuracy
increase at the increasing rate until the twenties iteration and
at a decreasing rate after the tenth iteration. Similarly, the loss
of training is decreasing at the rate of decreasing rate until the
twenties iteration and at rate of increasing rate.
VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS
On the basis of the symptoms seen on the leaves, a limited
amount of study has been done on the automated diagnosis
of coffee leaf diseases. Therefore, the goal of this article was
to create a model to identify coffee leaf disease at its early
stage.

==== CHUNK ====

This model would be extremely helpful to farmers,
extension agents, and agricultural experts, and it will also
boost the quality and quantity of coffee crops produced for
5
the export market. As a result, we put forth a method for
employing a convolutional neural network to identify and
categorize coffee leaf disease in Ethiopian coffee leaves. The
Resnet50 model’s experiment on transfer learning produced
a 99.89% accuracy result, outperforming the approaches that
were examined over training from scratch and MobileNet.

==== CHUNK ====

As
a result, the four classes of coffee leaf diseases can be readily
identified and classified with high performance utilizing our
constructed model employing Resnet50.
In this paper, we only examined three classes of diseased
coffee beans and one healthy class. However, these are not
the only coffee leaf diseases that exist. Therefore, in order
to enhance performance, we advise future researchers to add
more classes for Coffee Leaf Disease and expand the size
of the dataset.

==== CHUNK ====

Future studies may also compare other deep
learning algorithms with other pre-trained models to obtain
even greater categorization accuracy.
